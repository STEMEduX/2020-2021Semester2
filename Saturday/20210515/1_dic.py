## Dictionary

## Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
## A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and does not allow duplicates.

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

## Dictionary Items
## Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964
# }
# print(thisdict["brand"])

## Ordered or Unordered?
## As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

## Changeable
## Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.


## Duplicates Not Allowed

# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964,
#   "year": 2020
# }
# print(thisdict)
